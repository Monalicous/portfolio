# HTML has a lay out of my page divided into sections namely:
Home 
about me
goals
and skills 
in the bottom it has some icons for social media and a footer at the end.

# CSS

 hover effects for cards and icons 
 scroll effect for the page as well 
 colors
 flex display grid as well
 grid as well however w3schools lay outs was used to make things easeir because my css has lots of styling already.
